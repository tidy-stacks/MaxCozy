Second version of the Tea Cozy project .


Deciding to showcase everything I learnt so far in terms of creating responsive webpages, tokk it upon myself to create a second version of the Tea Cozy website beyond the design spec. The most notable improvment to this version of the website is: Everything being optimized for Mobile. This means on smaller resolution screens the top navigation menu becomes a hamburger menu style with a teacup. Also other website sections will stack to accomodate smaller screen sizes. Lastly, implemented a tiny form because it would be a useful functionality if on the landing page people can make a reservation. 

Here's what the site looks like along with the tea cup hamburger menu I implemented using HTML
