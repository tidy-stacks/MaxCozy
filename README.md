Second version of the Tea Cozy project .


Deciding to showcase everything I learnt so far in terms of creating responsive webpages, tokk it upon myself to create a second version of the Tea Cozy website beyond the design spec. The most notable improvment to this version of the website is: Everything being optimized for Mobile. This means on smaller resolution screens the top navigation menu becomes a hamburger menu style with a teacup. Also other website sections will stack to accomodate smaller screen sizes. Lastly, implemented a tiny form because it would be a useful functionality if on the landing page people can make a reservation. 

The source html and css files can be found at index.html and style.css along with the all the image files being located in the image folder.

Here's what the site looks like along with the tea cup hamburger menu I implemented using HTML
